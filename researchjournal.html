        <h2>project 2a: web design</h2>

        <p>Through the creation of this initial static website, I honed my existing frontend development skills to
          create a site without the constraints of a usual brief. I enjoyed the ability to test my programming skills
          without needing to prioritise mobile responsiveness, which is the approach I usually take for website design
          in my UX Design subjects. I initially chose a conservative layout under the assumption that this project had
          the constraints my other assignments usually do, but branched out into more experimental sketches once I
          realised this was not the case. The most difficult part of Project 2A for me was creating a grid layout for
          the different planets. They had the appearance of being placed irregularly, but had to stay in
          differently-spaced grid divs in order to preserve the layout on mobile. I had some trouble making the planets
          and stars in the layout maintain a reasonable size while still being spaced apart from each other. Translating
          my unique layout into a mobile version was a new and challenging experience, and overcoming this hurdle gives
          me the confidence to push the boundaries on what I can bring into my website designs. </p>

        <h2>scale of the universe</h2>
        <p>Originally created by Cary and Michael Huang in 2010, <i><a href="https://htwins.net/scale2/"
              rel="_blank">Scale of the Universe</a></i> is an interactive website that allows users to visualise the
          size of different objects in the universe, from galaxies to quarks. A sequel was
          created in 2012 with a more polished appearance. The site is
          interacted with using a scrollbar that the player uses to navigate different size ranges, displaying objects
          to scale. </p>

        <p>I was inspired by this site not only due to the presence of space-related objects (in the form of celestial
          bodies being compared), but because the use of a simple interactive element allowed for hours of
          exploration on the site.</p>

        <h2>nukemap</h2>
        <p><i><a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/" rel="_blank">NUKEMAP</a></i> allows the user to simulate
          the detonation of a nuclear bomb at a location of their choice. After selecting the yield of the bomb and a
          location, the site calculates the size of the blast radius and the estimated death toll. The death toll only
          accounts for deaths from the explosion, and does not include those from radioactive fallout. </p>
        <p>This website is a chilling interactive tool that reminds us of the power of nuclear bombs. The
          ability to select any location as ground zero for the bomb allows us to envision what it would be like if a
          bomb was dropped on our place of residence, and the death and destruction that would follow. Through a very
          simple premise, <i>NUKEMAP</i> serves as an effective anti-nuclear warfare message.</p>

        <p><i><a href="https://www.mysterysearch.lol/" rel="_blank">Mystery Search</a></i> functions identically to a

          user, while the results they should have received will be shown to the next person to use the site.</p>

        <p>The site acts as a collaborative artwork, where users entrust their search results to the next person and
          hope that the previous search result is to their liking. By removing the core functionality of a search
          engine, the ability to receive results for what you want, the site turns it into an interactive experience
          that makes use of uncertainty.</p>

          is a time capsule of early 2000s aesthetics and advertisements from websites that bought space on the site,
          most of which are now defunct.</p>
        <p>Though online advertising with images and links is ubiquitous today, this site gathered significant attention

        <h2>project 2b: creative coding</h2>
        <p>Being able to experiment with different Javascript libraries was an eye-opening experience. My prior use of
          Javascript in other classes had been limited to strictly functional elements, so I wasn't aware of p5.js and
          other Javascript libraries that expanded the scope of what I could do with Javascript. My initial additions to
          the site were basic features such as playing a sound effect upon clicking, but I enjoyed looking through the
          p5.js website for other libraries I could incorporate into my work. I particularly liked using the p5play
          library, and was impressed by its physics engine and potential for interactivity. If I expanded this project
          beyond the scope of the class, I would explore ways to take the spaceship concept into a navigable 3D space.
          The most difficult part of this project for me was trying to import libraries, as several ideas I had had to
          be abandoned because the library did not function in my browser. If I had the time, I would have tested my
          webpage on multiple different browsers to troubleshoot the problem. The lack of detailed examples or
          documentation for some libraries was also an issue, particularly because of my inexperience with p5.js.</p>

        <h2>library of babel</h2>
        <p><i><a rel="_blank" href="https://libraryofbabel.info/">Library of Babel</a></i> is a website created by
          Jonathan Basile in 2015, based on the short story "The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges. Similar to the
          titular library, the website contains every possible permutation of letters and punctuation within a 3200
          character limit. Like in the "infinite monkeys with typewriters" thought experiment, some of these randomly
          generated pages will have legible words by sheer chance. Basile calls this website an example of "iterature",
          a combination of literature and iterability.</p>
        <p>I found this site interesting as it fit into the "nonsense" theme of this subject. The idea that meaningful
          phrases created by chance exist in the site, waiting for a visitor to stumble upon it, is a creative
          application of a thought experiment in the form of a website.</p>

        <h2>nested</h2>
        <p><i><a rel="_blank" href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/nested">Nested</a></i> is a "simulation of everything" by
          Orteil. True to its name, the site consists of a series of infinitely nested objects (presented in the form of
          tabs). Users can open an object tab to view all the objects it contains; once the subatomic level is reached
          and the smallest particle (a quark) opened, the cycle resets as the quark contains an entirely new universe
          within it. According to the developer, all elements inside <i>Nested</i> are randomised from a possible pool
          of objects its parent can contain.
        </p>

        <p>To me, this web experiment is an example of how uncertainty, a large number of choices and an intriguing
          premise are just as important to an interactive experience. It is easy to get lost in the large number of
          interactive tabs and explore different objects contained within this randomly generated universe, even though
          the code behind the page is relatively simple. <i>Nested</i> reminds me that interactive media can be
          interesting without being complex—it just needs to compel the user.

              Laboratory</a></i> is a web experiment that allows users to play around with words and their
          pronunciations. Through a variety of machine learning-assisted tools on the page, users can enter a phrase and
          alter it using different parameters to receive a different spelling that results in the slight mutation of the
          word. With enough modification, the output will become unrecognisable from the original, thus becoming
          "nonsense".</p>
        <p>As someone interested in linguistics, this website is very interesting to play around with in how it
          simulates linguistic drift and explains how spellings change over time. The wide number of variables I can
          alter provide me with plenty of ways to modify words and create my own nonsensical speech. Beyond being an
          enjoyable experience, this website helps introduce the basics of linguistic principles in an accessible way.

          AI. The user starts off with the four classical elements, which can be combined together to create new words.
          The use of AI means that words can be combined infinitely with no restrictions. The game encourages

        <h2>project 2c: physical computing</h2>
        <p>I had limited experience with Arduino components and programming before this part of the subject, but being
          able to play around with the basic sample circuits gave me some understanding of how I could create my own
          physical computing experiments. I particularly enjoyed doing experiments with the different types of sensors,
          which open up the potential for interactivity beyond simple button presses. I also liked the LED and LCD
          displays and their potential as an output interface for user interactions. One issue I encountered was the
          inconsistent power source of my laptop, which hindered the ability for some of the components to properly
          function. Being able to power my Arduino wit a powerbank helped solve this issue somewhat. Additionally, my
          lack of experience with C++ meant that I did not get to program my own circuits from scratch during the
          physical computing unit. However, I greatly enjoyed working in the makerspace and exploring an area of
          interactive media I previously had very limited knowledge of. The skills I learnt here were only foundational,
          but they are incredibly valuable, and I look forward to exploring what Arduino can do further in my own time.

        <p>This work fascinates me as it fits into the "synaesthesia" portion of this subject, directly translating
          brain activity in the form of an artwork instead of simply visualising a sense. The circular eyelike etchings

        <h2>dial-a-poem</h2>
        <p><i>Dial-a-Poem</i> is a phone service created in 1968 by John Giorno. This service allowed its users to call
          a number and listen to a random poem from a selection of writers. The poetry included countercultural content
          including those celebrating queer love and Black Panther speeches; as a result, the original service was shut
          down in 1970. There have been several iterations of <i>Dial-a-Poem</i> across the years.</p>

        <p>Though it does not resemble computing as we know today, this service is notable as an early example
          of art expressed through interactions between humans and electronic devices. In Giorno's words, “the voice was
          the poet, the words were the poem, and the telephone was the venue”. The experience of hearing a poem
          read to you is an intimate one, as if the poet is confessing their deepest thoughts to you. This intimacy
          contrasts with the physical distance of a phone call between two locations, leading to a novel experience for
          the time.</p>

          with the ultimately semipredictable computer algorithms that generate random numbers, showing how living

        <p>The installation interests me due to how a nonhuman organism is interacting with a computer; in this case,
          being part of a process for generating random numbers. Though we often assume that computer interaction can
          only be performed by humans or trained animals, this installation could not exist without the jellyfish's

        <h2>heterobota</h2>
        <p>Created by Agnieszka Pilat, <i>Heterobota</i> consists of three dog robots from Boston Dynamics, which are
          provided with a canvas on the wall and some painting tools. Vistors to the installation can observe the robots
          in their enclosure as they go about their daily routines and create their own art. The art, while technically
          rudimentary, is made semi-autonomously by the robots without any human input.</p>

        <p>According to the artist, the work questions our threshold for machines to exist outside of their designated
          functions. In my opinion, this theme is particularly emphasized through the specific robots used in the
          installation; these robot dogs are used by police, and are capable of causing serious injury to a human. They
          have been widely criticised for threatening civil liberties. I find the contrast between the violence of their

	<h1 class="glow">offline algorithmic thinking</h1>
	<p>
		To practice offline algorithmic thinking, I designed a game that would generate shapes on a piece of
		paper according to the results of dice rolls. Some aspects I thought could be determined by dice
		rolls were the shape's location, its colour and the number of sides it has. As I had a d6 (six-sided
		die) and d4 (four-sided die) at my disposal, I decided to divide the paper into equal sections that
		would help determine the location of the shape. To diversify the shapes, the number of sides was
		decided by a d4 + d6, with an exception where a result of (1, 1) would result in the shape being a
		triangle.
	</p>

	<p>The playtest generated a variety of unique shapes, but their locations were rather uninteresting. If
		I refined this game, I would leave more things up to chance, as other aspects such as
		the specific shape and location were still left up to the player.</p>

	<h2>translating into p5.js</h2>
	<p>I translated my game into a p5.js sketch using the knowledge from this week's workshop. Generating
		polygons proved to be the most difficult part of the code due to it requiring geometry knowledge (to
		place vertex points on a circle around the original starting point),
		and I used an AI program to generate the code for that specific functionality.</p>

	<p>I'm happy with the Javascript implementation, as the rules for the dice game were successfully followed.</p>

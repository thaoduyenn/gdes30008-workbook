				<p>
					To practice offline algorithmic thinking, I designed a game that would generate shapes on a piece of
					paper according to the results of dice rolls. Some aspects I thought could be determined by dice
					rolls were the shape's location, its colour and the number of sides it has. As I had a d6 (six-sided
					die) and d4 (four-sided die) at my disposal, I decided to divide the paper into equal sections that
					would help determine the location of the shape. To diversify the shapes, the number of sides was
					decided by a d6 + d4, with an exception where a result of (1, 1) would result in the shape being a
					triangle.

				<p>The playtest generated a variety of unique shapes, but their locations were rather uninteresting. If
					I refined this game, I would leave more things up to chance, as other aspects such as
					the specific shape and location were still left up to the player.</p>

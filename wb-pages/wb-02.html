    As I took some UI/UX design classes previously as part of my major, I
    already had VSCode set up on my laptop and an understanding of the process
    of developing a webpage, from wireframes to writing the frontend code. For
    Week 1, I decided to forgo any detailed CSS styling in favour of setting up
    the basic layout for my workbook and research journal and adding in
    rudimentary information.

    Out of habit from my prior coding projects, I made the site layout
    responsive so that it could also be viewed and interacted with on mobile.
    While the two columns display side-by-side on desktop, they are stacked on
    top of each other on mobile screens.

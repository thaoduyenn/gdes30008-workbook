		<h2>blink!</h2>

		<p>I started off with a simple LED light circuit and a program that causes it to blink at specified intervals.
			Though the circuitry was simple to set up, one thing I had to keep in mind was the breadboard's layout and
			the importance of grounding, due to the power source I used being my laptop. Improper circuitry could lead
			to the damage of components on the breadboard, or of the Arduino control board itself. I modified the
			circuitry and the Arduino code slightly so that the blinking would alternate between two different LEDs.</p>

		<h2>touch!</h2>

		<p>I experimented with the light sensor in a circuit, adding a motor so it would spin slightly to
			indicate the sensor's activation. I will need to explore how this component works further, as it took a few
			attempts of blocking the sensor's light source with my finger for it to work. I also tested the potential of
			using different conductive materials in order to complete a circuit.</p>

		<p>The most complex circuit I created was one that would display a custom scrolling animation on an 8x8 LED
			grid. I used a tool that converted a bitmap sprite to a series of hex codes, which the Arduino would
			interpret as
			binary (meaning a LED in a certain position woukd either be off or on). Due to insufficient power, the LED
			grid only functioned partially, but it displayed the intended scrolling animation.</p>

		<h1 class="glow">user input</h1>
		<p>In my previous sketches, the method of user input was limited to clicking and dragging directly on
			the canvas and one-button keyboard inputs. I was interested in the discussion of other Javascript
			libraries compatible with p5.js in class, so I explored the p5.js site for ones that might provide
			different methods of interactivity. I found the p5play library, which had a basic physics engine and
			the ability to create basic 2D platformers, and was interested in its applications. Demonstrated on this
			page is the result of some experimentation with the library to create a basic solar system, with a star
			attracting smaller celestial bodies.</p>

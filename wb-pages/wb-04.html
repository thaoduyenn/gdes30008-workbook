      Following on from my concept of a space-themed shooter, I began styling
      my page to fit the aesthetics that I had in mind. The background would
      be the area of space that users were looking outwards at. I decided on
      monospace and sans serif fonts to add to the futuristic look of the
      site, and used light colours to contrast with the background. The rest
      of the site components would slowly be implemented.

      I continued refining my site, replacing my placeholder images and adding
      assets that would fit the sci-fi aesthetic. I also implemented some
      rudimentary animation for the site, including a glowing effect on header
      text (to mimic a digital display) and tooltips that appear when each
      target is hovered over that show the title of the destination page.

      For some of my shorter workbook entries, I used a two-column layout to
      minimize space. In order to make reading it more intuitive, I aligned
      the contents of the right column to the right to distinguish it from the
      left column. I decided against using this for longer entries, as the
      reader would have to scroll back and forth in order to read all the
      content. I am pleased with the implementation of this layout, and will
      likely use it for my research journal as well.

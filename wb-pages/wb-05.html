          The hardest thing to implement for a responsive mobile version of my webpage was the layout of the celestial
          bodies.
          I knew I had to use a grid system to preserve the layout, but wanted the images to be distributed in a way
          that seemed more natural.
          I made some initial sketches for the mobile version of the site, which largely preserves all the desktop
          elements. In the end, my
          solution was to use different <i>fr</i> values for different rows so that the grid cells would be spaced
          unevenly.

      <div class="flex-col right">
        <p>This fluid design was implemented successfully, with the only difference being that the uneven sizing of the
          images due to different grid widths.
          However, as I am simulating a spaceship cockpit view for this site, the smaller image sizes add to immersion
          by making them seem further away.</p>

        <h2>media queries</h2>
        <p>Media queries were used to alter the functionality of my site on mobile. For example, as mobile users cannot
          hover over images,
          I disabled the tooltip feature on mobile. I also used media queries for minor layout changes that fit mobile
          screens better.</p>

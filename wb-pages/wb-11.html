		<h1 class="glow">workbook development</h1>

		<p>Following the feedback from Project 2A, I modified my workbook to improve upon the page design, as well as
			incorporate p5.js elements in order to add to the sci-fi theme. Realising that the two-column layout caused
			the pages to appear too cramped, I increased the margin on my page elements and reverted to a centered
			one-column layout for my workbook entries. I also modified the text on the landing page to fall more in line
			with the spaceship concept.</p>
		<p>Below is a before-and-after comparison of the workbook entry layout:</p>

		<h2>p5.js integration</h2>
		<p>Due to its wide array of features, I decided to use the p5play library alongside the base p5.js and p5.sound
			libraries. I wanted to focus on the spaceship cockpit aspect of the home page, adding interactive elements
			that mimic informational screens a cockpit display would have. This would utilize the knowledge I have
			accumulated through my experimentation. Before implementing code, I sketched the
			layout of the planned p5.js elements:</p>

		<p>The most difficult part to implement was the spaceship lasers. I did not want them to exist
			for too long on the screen, so I used the "life" attribute in p5play to remove the laser beams after a
			certain number
			of frames.</p>

		<img class="screenshot" title="Image of updated mobile site." src="wb-images/wb-11-04.jpg">
		<p>I ultimately decided against including the p5.js interactivity on mobile, as the cockpit layout was intended
			for desktop screens. A media query was used to hide the p5.js canvas on mobile screen sizes.</p>

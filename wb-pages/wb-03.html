    <h1>paper prototyping</h1>

    <p>
      To sketch prototypes for this workbook, I followed the "crazy eights"
      ideation method, which involved sketching eight ideas in eight minutes.
      However, I did not realise that this workbook would be developed into a
      fully interactive website and that mobile compatibility was not a concern,
      so my initial sketches were relatively simple static pages.

    <p>
      I followed with some sketches of website ideas with other interactive
      components, largely based on simple video games (such as snake or a basic
      shooter). I decided to further develop of the concept of a space-themed
      shooter where different targets were different links, as I felt it was
      feasible to implement.

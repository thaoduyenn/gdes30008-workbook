          To sketch prototypes for this workbook, I followed the "crazy eights"
          ideation method, which involved sketching eight ideas in eight minutes.
          However, I did not realise that this workbook would be developed into a
          fully interactive website and that mobile compatibility was not a
          primary concern, so my initial sketches were relatively simple static pages.

          After deciding to prioritize desktop views, I followed with sketches of website ideas with other interactive
          components, largely based on simple video games (such as Snake or a
          basic shooter). I decided to further develop of the concept of a
          space-themed shooter where different targets were different links, as I
          felt it was feasible to implement. Although my focus at this point would be creating the basic static site,
          some additional features I had in mind were keyboard controls to "move" the viewport around (by moving the
          positioning of images), sound effects and background animations. This would make the site more interactive.

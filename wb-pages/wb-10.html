		<h2>offline data sorting</h2>

		<p>An exercise I did in this week's workshop was to sort data: in this case, the data was the contents
			of my backpack and other bags. I decided to sort them by functionality, which was how I would have
			instinctively sorted my belongings. Other ways I could have sorted them include colour, material,
			and monetary value.</p>
		<p>I also practiced data sorting to form a narrative. Combining my belongings with that of a classmate's, we
			crafted a narrative where we had just murdered someone and had these items at our disposal, fitting them
			into our plan to clean up the evidence and escape police capture.</p>
